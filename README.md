### Description
```bash
This MBTI analysis is applicable in both English and Mandarin
Tab 1: Chat Analysis (Group Chat)
  - Upload a .txt chat history file (LINE/WhatsApp format). The tool automatically detects distinct speakers
  - Select specific participants to analyze. The AI examines their tone, vocabulary, and interaction patterns to estimate their MBTI personality type
  - Chat with Data: ask specific questions about the analysis or generate metaphorical art representing the group dynamic or generate interactive charts or get a recommendation of meeting point
